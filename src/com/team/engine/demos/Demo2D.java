/**
 * Pretty simple implementation of a platformer.
 * 
 * The general idea behind it is to have a main square collider for your normal collision stuff
 * (aka walls, ceilings, bullets, goombas, whatever) and a second circle collider just a tiny bit
 * below the square collider. The sphere collider has an immense amount of drag so stopping and going
 * is pretty much instant. Because only the sphere touches the ground and not anything else, we can determine
 * that the player is on the ground if the sphere is touching something since the ground is all it's able to
 * touch. If we're touching a wall the only thing colliding will be the cube because it extends further along X
 * than the radius of the sphere.
 * 
 * Theoretically we could have 4 spheres all offset in each direction so then we could have wall jumping and stuff.
 * 
 * I believe this approach is called the unicycle but don't quote me there.

		 * We can't just give the cube high drag either or you would be able to stick
		 * to walls. So for now, the sphere collider is solid and the player actually
		 * floats above the ground a bit (not a problem if you stretch your sprite though).
